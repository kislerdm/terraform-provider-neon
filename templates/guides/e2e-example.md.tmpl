# End-to-end example: AWS Application

The guide illustrates how to provision infrastructure for an application deployed in AWS to communicate with the Neon
database.

## Prerequisites

- terraform ~> v1.1
- Neon SaaS [API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys/)
- AWS account and role with sufficient privileges

## Code Snippet

The code below documents the following resources:

- the Neon stack:
    - project;
    - dedicated branch with
        - role;
        - database;
- the AWS Secretsmanager secret to store database access details securely;
- the AWS IAM policy to be attached to the AWS IAM role assumed by an application intended to communicate with the Neon
  database.

## Execution

1. Export API keys as environment variables:
   ```commandline
   export NEON_API_KEY=##neon api key##
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=##AWS access key ID##
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=##AWS access secret##
   ```
2. Create the file `main.tf` and copy the code [snippet](#code-snippet) there.
3. Initialize the terraform to download required providers:
   ```commandline
   terraform init
   ```
   ~> Note that the terraform state will be stored locally. Find more
   details [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration).
4. Validate the syntax correctness:
   ```commandline
   terraform validate
   ```
5. Run terraform plan:
   ```commandline
   terraform plan
   ```
   Expected output in stdout:
   ```commandline
    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create
     <= read (data resources)
    
    Terraform will perform the following actions:
    
      # data.aws_iam_policy_document.neon_access_secret will be read during apply
      # (config refers to values not yet known)

    Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
   ```
6. Run terraform apply:
   ```commandline
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```
   Expected output in stdout:
   ```commandline
   Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
   ```
7. Done! The database can be accessed using the connection details from the AWS secretsmanager.
8. Clean the demo infrastructure:
   ```commandline
   terraform destroy -auto-approve
   ```
   Expected output in stdout:
   ```commandline
   Destroy complete! Resources: 7 destroyed.
   ```
9. Unset environment variables:
   ```commandline
   unset NEON_API_KEY
   unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   ```
