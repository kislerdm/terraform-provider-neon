# neon_endpoint (Resource)

Project Endpoint. See details: https://neon.tech/docs/manage/endpoints/

!> Note that "read_write" type is only supported yet, and a single "read_write" endpoint is permitted per branch. It means that no additional endpoints can be provisioned for branches with existing endpoints. It also means that no endpoints can be created for branches provisioned with this terraform provider because every branch has the default endpoint attached.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "neon_project" "example" {
  name = "foo"
}

resource "neon_branch" "example" {
  project_id = neon_project.example.id
  name       = "bar"
}

resource "neon_endpoint" "example" {
  project_id = neon_project.example.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.example.id
  type       = "read_write"
}
```
