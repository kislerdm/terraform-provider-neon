## Schema

### Optional

- `branch` (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--branch))
- `compute_provisioner` (String) Provisioner The Neon compute provisioner.
Specify the k8s-neonvm provisioner to create a compute endpoint that supports Autoscaling.
- `default_endpoint_settings` (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--default_endpoint_settings))
- `history_retention_seconds` (Number) The number of seconds to retain the point-in-time restore (PITR) backup history for this project
- `name` (String) Project name.
- `pg_version` (Number) Postgres version
- `quota` (Block Set) Per-project consumption quota. If the quota is exceeded, all active computes
are automatically suspended and it will not be possible to start them with
an API method call or incoming proxy connections. The only exception is
logical_size_bytes, which is applied on per-branch basis, i.e., only the
compute on the branch that exceeds the logical_size quota will be suspended.

Quotas are enforced based on per-project consumption metrics with the same names,
which are reset at the end of each billing period (the first day of the month).
Logical size is also an exception in this case, as it represents the total size
of data stored in a branch, so it is not reset.

The zero value per attributed means 'unlimited'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--quota))
- `region_id` (String) AWS Region.
- `store_password` (Boolean) Whether or not passwords are stored for roles in the Neon project. Storing passwords facilitates access to Neon features that require authorization.

### Read-Only

- `connection_uri` (String, Sensitive) Default connection uri. **Note** that it contains access credentials.
- `database_host` (String) Default database host.
- `database_name` (String) Default database name.
- `database_password` (String, Sensitive) Default database access password.
- `database_user` (String) Default database role.
- `default_branch_id` (String) Default branch ID.
- `id` (String) Project ID.

<a id="nestedblock--branch"></a>
### Nested Schema for `branch`

Optional:

- `database_name` (String) The database name. If not specified, the default database name will be used.
- `name` (String) The branch name. If not specified, the default branch name will be used.
- `role_name` (String) The role name. If not specified, the default role name will be used.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Branch ID.


<a id="nestedblock--default_endpoint_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `default_endpoint_settings`

Optional:

- `autoscaling_limit_max_cu` (Number)
- `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` (Number)
- `suspend_timeout_seconds` (Number) Duration of inactivity in seconds after which the compute endpoint is automatically suspended. 
The value 0 means use the global default.
The value -1 means never suspend. The default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
The maximum value is 604800 seconds (1 week)


<a id="nestedblock--quota"></a>
### Nested Schema for `quota`

Optional:

- `active_time_seconds` (Number) The total amount of wall-clock time allowed to be spent by the project's compute endpoints.
- `compute_time_seconds` (Number) The total amount of CPU seconds allowed to be spent by the project's compute endpoints.
- `data_transfer_bytes` (Number) Total amount of data transferred from all of a project's branches using the proxy.
- `logical_size_bytes` (Number) Limit on the logical size of every project's branch.
- `written_data_bytes` (Number) Total amount of data written to all of a project's branches.
