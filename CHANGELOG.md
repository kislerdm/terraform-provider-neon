## [v0.8.0] - 2025-02-24

### Added

- [[#144](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/144)] Added the resource `neon_jwks_url` 
  to manage the JWKs URL provided by the 3rd-party IdP required to establish [Neon RLS authorization](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-rls-authorize).

### Changed

## [v0.7.1] - 2025-02-19

### Fixed

- Fixed the note about the endpoints types.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies:
  - Neon Go SDK: [v0.13.0](https://github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0)

## [v0.7.0] - 2025-02-19

### Added

- Added the "User-Agent" header injected to every request to the Neon API for tracking purposes as agreed with
  James Broadhead from Neon.
- Added the resource `neon_api_key` to manage Neon API keys.

### Fixed

- [[#119](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/119)] Fixed the output attribute `host` of the
  resource `neon_endpoint`: it will yield the correct URI for the endpoints with the
  [pooled mode](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-pooling#how-to-use-connection-pooling) activated.
- [[#137](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/137)] Fixed operations execution management

- Documentation improvements:
  - Removed unclear warning from the page for the `neon_endpoint` resource.

### Removed

- Removed the outdated warning which was showing upon creation of the endpoint of the type "read_only",
- Removed the attributes "allowed_ips_primary_branch_only" from the resource `neon_project` because it's no longer supported by Neon.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies:
  - Neon Go SDK: [v0.12.0](https://github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go/compare/v0.6.1...v0.12.0)

### Added

- Added the attribute `protected` for the resource `neon_branch` to provision protected branches.

### Fixed

- [[#108](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/108)] Fixed the import behaviour for the resource `neon_role`.
- Fixed mutability of the default branch by adjusting the behaviour for the `branch` state of the resource `neon_project`.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies:

## [v0.6.1] - 2024-09-28

### Added

- Added support of Postgres 17. See the Neon [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/postgres-17) and the Postgres 
  [announcement](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/).

### Fixed

- Fixed validation of the autoscalling limits. You can now set the maximum compute size up to `10`.

## [v0.6.0] - 2024-09-23

### Added

- [[#99](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/99)] Added the attribute `org_id` to
  the resource `neon_project` to create project in the organisation.

### Fixed

- **[BREAKING]** [[#96](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/96)] The boolean attributes of the 
  resource `neon_project` will be treated as strings to work around the 
  [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/817) with state management when the attribute gets
  removed from the manifest.

**Examples**

- Set allowed_ips to be applicable only to the primary branch:
  ```terraform
   resource "neon_project" "this" {
      name = "myproject"
      
      allowed_ips = ["1.2.3.4/24"]

      allowed_ips_primary_branch_only = "yes"
   }
  ``` 
- Set allowed_ips to be applicable to all branches, explicitly:
  ```terraform
   resource "neon_project" "this" {
      name = "myproject"
      
      allowed_ips = ["1.2.3.4/24"]

      allowed_ips_primary_branch_only = "no"
   }
  ```
- Set allowed_ips to be applicable to all branches, implicitly:
  ```terraform
   resource "neon_project" "this" {
      name = "myproject"
      
      allowed_ips = ["1.2.3.4/24"]
   }
  ```

## [v0.2.2] - 2023-09-19

### Fixed

- `resource_project`:
    - ([#40](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/40)) Fixed types conversion for the terraform
      resource attributes of the
      type [`TypeInt`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/blob/af738e0d482f699504d9e35e134766da459ef1f6/helper/schema/schema.go#L55).
    - ([#42](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/42)) Fixed default branch configuration.
    - ([#48](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/issues/48)) Fixed default endpoint settings
      configuration.
    - Fixed history retention configuration. Now, the retention period of 7 days will be set by default, and zero will
      be set if `history_retention_seconds` is set to zero explicitly.

**Note** web console will reflect the data retention period correctly only if `history_retention_seconds` was set to an
integral number of days because the web console shows the total number of full days only. Moreover, "7 days - default"
will be displayed for any `history_retention_seconds` value below 86400 (1 day).

| history_retention_seconds | web console      | human-friendly duration |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| 0                         | 7 days - default | 0                       |
| 300                       | 7 days - default | 5 min                   |
| 3600                      | 7 days - default | 1 hour                  |
| 43200                     | 7 days - default | 12 hours                |
| 164160                    | 1 day            | 1.9 days                |
| 198720                    | 2 days           | 2.3 days                |
| 604800                    | 7 days - default | 7 days                  |

### Changed

- Fixed typo and indentation of documentation

  interactions with the branch to manage associated roles and databases.

### Changed

- Improved documentation
- Added an end-to-end guide to provision resources for AWS application to communicate with the Neon database

## [0.0.8] - 2023-01-08

### Added

- Database resource:

```terraform
resource "neon_database" "this" {
  project_id = "bitter-meadow-966132"
  branch_id  = "br-floral-mountain-251143"
  name       = "baz"
  owner_name = "qux"
}
```

## [0.0.7] - 2023-01-08

### Added

- Role resource:

```terraform
resource "neon_role" "this" {
  project_id = "bitter-meadow-966132"
  branch_id  = "br-floral-mountain-251143"
  name       = "qux"
}
```

## [0.0.6] - 2023-01-08

### Fixed

- Fixed `neon_endpoint` resource provisioning when the attribute `pg_settings` is not set. The bug was in the Neon SDK,
  see
  details in the [release notes](https://github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go/releases/tag/v0.1.4).

### Changed

- Bumped [Neon Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go) to v0.1.4

## [0.0.5] - 2023-01-07

### Fixed

- Fixed the logic to import `neon_branch` resource by its ID.

## [0.0.4] - 2023-01-07

### Added

- Endpoint resource:

```terraform
resource "neon_endpoint" "this" {
  project_id = "bitter-meadow-966132"
  branch_id  = "br-floral-mountain-251143"
  type       = "read_write"
}
```

## [0.0.3] - 2023-01-07

### Added

- Added database connection details for the resource `neon_project`. **Note** that `database_password`
  and `connection_uri` read-only attributes are sensitive. Make sure that terraform backend is secured and
  terraform state is not exposed to prevent undesirable access to database.

## [0.0.2] - 2023-01-07

### Added

- Branch resource:

```terraform
resource "neon_project" "this" {
  name = "foo"
}

resource "neon_branch" "this" {
  project_id = neon_project.this.id
  name       = "bar"
}
```

- Backoff+retry mechanism: operation is retried after the delay of 5 sec. API response's HTTP codes are 500, or 429.
  Total number of attempts is limited to 120 per operation.

### Changed

- Bumped [Neon Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go) v0.1.3
- Added errors handling for the project resource

## [0.0.1] - 2023-01-05

### Added

- `Neon` Provider:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    neon = {
      source = "kislerdm/neon"
    }
  }
}

provider "neon" {}
```

- Project resource:

```terraform
resource "neon_project" "this" {
  name = "foo"
}
```
